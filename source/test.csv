We investigated the changes of lysosomal Ca by mitochondrial or metabolic stress that can modulate TFEB activation and, additionally, the role of TFEB-induced mitophagy in β-cell function. Mitochondrial or metabolic stress induces mitophagy, which is mediated by lysosomal Ca release, increased cytosolic [Ca] and subsequent TFEB activation. Lysosomal Ca release is replenished by ERlysosome Ca refilling through ER Ca exit channels, which is important for the increase of cytosolic [Ca] and mitophagy by mitochondria stressors. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding augments pancreatic β-cell mitophagy, probably as an adaptation to metabolic stress. HFD-induced increase ofβ-cell mitophagy is reduced by  KO, leading to increased ROS and decreased mitochondrial complex activity or oxygen consumption in -KO islets. In  Δβ-cell mice, HFD-induced glucose intolerance and β-cell dysfunction are aggravated. Expression of mitophagy receptor genes including  or  is increased by mitochondrial or metabolic stressors in a TFEB-dependent manner, likely contributing to increased mitophagy.

Consistent with clinical syndromes, our lab has shown that sustained 14-day delivery of the COMT inhibitor OR486 in rodents results in pain at multiple body sites and pain-related volitional behaviors. The onset of COMT-dependent functional pain is mediated by peripheral β- and β-adrenergic receptors (β- and βARs) through the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Here, we first sought to investigate the role of β- and βARs and downstream mediators in the maintenance of persistent functional pain. We then aimed to characterize the resulting persistent inflammation in neural tissues (neuroinflammation), characterized by activated glial cells and phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Separate groups of rats were implanted with subcutaneous osmotic mini-pumps to deliver OR486 (15\u202fmg/kg/day) or vehicle for 14\u202fdays. The βAR antagonist ICI118551 and βAR antagonist SR59230A were co-administrated subcutaneously with OR486 or vehicle either on day 0 or day 7.

Behavioral responses, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, glial cell activation, and MAPK phosphorylation were measured over the course of 35\u202fdays. Our results demonstrate that systemic delivery of OR486 leads to mechanical hypersensitivity that persists for at least 3\u202fweeks after OR486 cessation. Corresponding increases in spinal TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels, microglia and astrocyte activation, and neuronal p38 and ERK phosphorylation were observed on days 14-35. Persistent functional pain was alleviated by systemic delivery of ICI118551 and SR59230A beginning on day 0, but not day 7, and by spinal delivery of Etanercept or SB203580 beginning on day 14.

Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced the nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species generation, while pre-incubation with MV inhibited these formations in a concentration-dependent manner. MV treatment also decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in C6 glial cells stimulated by LPS/IFN-γ. Compared to the LPS/IFN-γ-treated control group, the MV-treated group exerts downregulation in the protein expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, through inhibition of nuclear factor-κB activation. Protein expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 were also decreased in the MV-treated group. These findings suggest that MV prevents neuroinflammation by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway and glial activation.

Both genetic and environmental factors serve as etiologic factors. Recent genetic studies have identified at least 83 variants associated with diabetes. A significant number of these loci are thought to be involved in insulin secretion, either through β-cell development or β-cell dysfunction. Environmental factors have changed rapidly during the past half century, and the increased prevalence of obesity and diabetes can be attributed to these changes. Environmental factors may affect epigenetic changes and alter susceptibility to diabetes. A recent epidemiologic study revealed that Korean patients with type 2 diabetes already had impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance 10 years before the onset of diabetes.

Recent increase in dietary fructose consumption mirrors the rise in prevalence of cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy leading to concerns raised by public health experts. Mitochondria, comprising 30% of cardiomyocyte volume, play a central role in modulating redox-dependent cellular processes such as metabolism and apoptosis. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is a key cause of pathogenesis of fructose-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Naringin, a major flavanone glycoside in citrus species, has displayed strong antioxidant potential in models of oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluated protective effects of naringin against fructose-induced cardiac hypertrophy and associated mechanisms of action, using in vitro and in vivo models. We found that naringin suppressed mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes exposed to fructose and consequently reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by regulating AMPK-mTOR signaling axis. Furthermore, naringin counteracted fructose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and this function of naringin was linked to its ability to inhibit ROS-dependent ATM-mediated p53 signaling. This result was supported by observations in in vivo mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy.

27186363,diabetes,Contribution of the distal small intestine to metabolic improvement after bariatric/metabolic surgery: Lessons from ileal transposition surgery.,"OrderedDict([('AbstractText', 'Roux-en Y gastric bypass is a highly effective bariatric/metabolic surgical procedure that can induce robust weight loss and even remission of type\xa02 diabetes. One of the characteristic consequences of Roux-en Y gastric bypass is the expedited nutrient delivery to the distal small intestine, where L-cells are abundant and bile acid reabsorption occurs. To examine the role of the distal small intestine in isolation from other components of Roux-en Y gastric bypass, the ileal transposition (IT) surgery has been used in various rat models. IT relocates the distal ileal segment to the upper jejunum distal to the ligament of Treitz without any other alterations in the gastrointestinal anatomy. Therefore, IT exposes the distal ileal tissue to ingested nutrients after a meal faster than the normal condition. Although there is some inconsistency in the effect of IT according to different types of rat models and different types of surgical protocols, IT typically improved glucose tolerance, increased insulin sensitivity and induced weight loss, and the findings were more prominent in obese diabetic rats. Suggested mechanisms for the metabolic improvements after IT include increased L-cell secretion (e.g., glucagon-like peptides and peptide YY), altered bile acid metabolism, altered host-microbial interaction, attenuated metabolic endotoxemia and many others. Based on the effect of IT, we can conclude that the contribution of the distal small intestine to the metabolic benefits of bariatric/metabolic surgery is quite considerable.

This study was designed to establish rat models of dual stress using noise and restraint in order to investigate the effect of α-GPC on cognitive function and neuronal differentiation after dual stress. The rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows: a control group (CG), a control with α-GPC group (CDG), a noise-restraint stress group (NRSG), and a noise-restraint stress with α-GPC group (NRSDG). Experimental groups were exposed to a 110\xa0dB sound pressure level (SPL) white band noise and restraint at the same time for 3\xa0h/day for 7\xa0days. Alpha-GPC (400\xa0mg/kg) was administered orally after stress exposure for 7\xa0days. NRSG showed decreased memory function, increased stress hormone, hearing loss, and neuronal damage of the brain. In the hippocampus of NRSG, significantly increased expression of IL-1β and decreased expression of both choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and BDNF were observed. On the contrary, NRSDG showed better memory function compared to NRSG, which indicates the neuroprotective effect of α-GPC. In addition, NRSDG showed decreased immune response and increased ChAT and BDNF expression as well as neuroblast expression in the hippocampus, which suggests that α-GPC enhances BDNF expression and protects the activity of immature cells in the hippocampus.

To better understand how cetaceans have adapted to this virus-rich environment, we compared cetacean virus-responsive genes to those from terrestrial mammals. We identified virus-responsive gene sequences in seven species of cetaceans, which we compared with orthologous sequences in seven terrestrial mammals. As a result of evolution analysis using the branch model and the branch-site model, 21 genes were selected using at least one model. IFN-ε, an antiviral cytokine expressed at mucous membranes, and its receptor IFNAR1 contain cetacean-specific amino acid substitutions that might change the interaction between the two proteins and lead to regulation of the immune system against viruses. Cetacean-specific amino acid substitutions in IL-6, IL-27, and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 are also predicted to alter the mucosal immune response of cetaceans. Since mucosal membranes are the first line of defense against the external environment and are involved in immune tolerance, our analysis of cetacean virus-responsive genes suggests that genes with cetacean-specific mutations in mucosal immunity-related genes play an important role in the protection and/or regulation of immune responses against viruses.'), ('CopyrightInformation', '© 2022.

29540697,x,Kaempferol targeting on the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3-ribosomal S6 kinase 2 signaling axis prevents the development of rheumatoid arthritis.,"OrderedDict([('AbstractText', OrderedDict([('sup', ['+', '+']), ('#text', 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the synovial joints. Although involvement of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway has been suggested as an important modulator in RA development, no clear evidence has been provided. In this study, we found that synovial fluid basic FGF (bFGF) concentration was significantly higher in RA than in osteoarthritis (OA) patients. bFGF stimulates proliferation and migration of human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) by activation of the bFGF-FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3)-ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) signaling axis. Moreover, a molecular docking study revealed that kaempferol inhibited FGFR3 activity by binding to the active pocket of the FGFR3 kinase domain. Kaempferol forms hydrogen bonds with the FGFR3 backbone oxygen of Glu555 and Ala558 and the side chain of Lys508. Notably, the inhibition of bFGF-FGFR3-RSK2 signaling by kaempferol suppresses the proliferation and migration of RA FLSs and the release of activated T-cell-mediated inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IL-21, and TNF-α. We further found that activated phospho-FGFR3 and -RSK2 were more highly observed in RA than in OA synovium. The hyperplastic lining and sublining lymphoid aggregate layers of RA synovium showed p-RSK2-expressing CD68 macrophages with high frequency, while pRSK2-expressing CD4 T-cells was observed at a lower frequency. Notably, kaempferol administration in collagen-induced arthritis mice relieved the frequency and severity of arthritis. Kaempferol reduced osteoclast differentiation in vitro and in vivo relative to the controls and was associated with the inhibition of osteoclast markers, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, integrin β3, and MMP9. Conclusively, our data suggest that bFGF-induced FGFR3-RSK2 signaling may play a critical role during the initiation and progression of RA in terms of FLS proliferation and enhanced osteoclastogenesis, and that kaempferol may be effective as a new treatment for RA.')]))])"

Given that metformin acts on multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, and that AMPK and its downstream intracellular signaling control the activation and differentiation of T and B cells and inflammatory responses, metformin may exert immunomodulatory and anti- inflammatory effects. The efficacy of metformin has been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies on rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, ankylosing spondylitis, and gout. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms through which metformin exerts its therapeutic effects in these diseases, focusing particularly on rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis."")])"

MAM provides an excellent platform for numerous signaling pathways; among them, inflammatory signaling pathways associated with MAM play a critical role in cellular defense during pathogenic infections and metabolic disorders. However, induction of MAM causes deleterious effects by amplifying mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation through increased calcium transfer from the ER to mitochondria, thereby causing mitochondrial damage and release of mitochondrial components into the cytosol as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These mitochondrial DAMPs rapidly activate MAM-resident inflammasome components and other inflammatory factors, which promote inflammasome complex formation and release of proinflammatory cytokines in pathological conditions. Long-term stimulation of the inflammasome instigates chronic inflammation, leading to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of MAM and its association with inflammation-mediated metabolic diseases.')])"

We found a linear association between preoperative TSH levels and extra-thyroidal extension and lymph node metastasis. However, primary tumor size and initial distant metastasis showed a bimodal peak, which was similar to the pattern of overall and disease-specific death. We found that preoperative TSH range which showed the lowest mortality rate was about 0.8 to 1.59 mIU/L, which are slightly lower normal TSH levels. Although there was no linear trend, the primary tumor size, initial distant metastasis, and mortality of DTC were closely related with preoperative TSH decile and they showed a bimodal pattern. The results obtained in this study provide additional information for understanding the association between preoperative TSH levels and DTC prognosis.'), ('CopyrightInformation', '© 2021.

When hNME1 binds with pST8SIA1, it induces degradation of pST8SIA1 in mp AD-MSCs, thereby inhibiting the expression of ganglioside GD3 followed by decreased neuronal differentiation of mp AD-MSCs. Therefore, we produced nanobodies (NBs) named NB-hNME1 that bind to hNME1 specifically, and the inhibitory effect of NB-hNME1 was evaluated for blocking the binding between hNME1 and pST8SIA1. Consequently, NB-hNME1 effectively blocked the binding of hNME1 to pST8SIA1, thereby recovering the expression of ganglioside GD3 and neuronal differentiation of mp AD-MSCs.

Our immunohistochemical work shows that hypothalamic AVP cellular activity, as recognized by c-fos, was enhanced in parallel with an elevation in TonEBP expression within AVP cells following water deprivation. Interestingly, our  investigations found a synchronized pattern of TonEBP and AVP gene expression in response to osmotic stress. Those results indicate a positive correlation between hypothalamic TonEBP and AVP production during dehydration. Promoter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that TonEBP can bind directly to conserved binding motifs in the 5'-flanking promoter regions of the AVP gene. Furthermore, dehydration- and TonEBP-mediated hypothalamic AVP gene activation was reduced in TonEBP haploinsufficiency mice, compared with wild TonEBP homozygote animals. Therefore, our result support the idea that TonEBP is directly necessary, at least in part, for the elevation of AVP transcription in dehydration conditions. Additionally, dehydration-induced reductions in body weight were rescued in TonEBP haploinsufficiency mice. Altogether, our results demonstrate an intracellular machinery within hypothalamic AVP cells that is responsible for dehydration-induced AVP synthesis."")])), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2021 Kim, Kim, Lee, Eom, Kim, Park, Jeong and Lee.')])"

Their regulation has been extensively studied, especially in podocytes, but also in mesangial cells and other cell types present in the kidney. More recent evidence has implicated TRPC6 in renal fibrosis and tubulointerstitial disease caused by urinary obstruction. Consequently TRPC6 is being extensively investigated as a target for drug discovery. Other TRPC family members are present in kidney. TRPC6 can form a functional heteromultimer with TRPC3, and it has been suggested that TRPC5 may also play a role in glomerular disease progression, although the evidence on this is contradictory.

The relationship between each obesity index and elevated hs-CRP levels was significant in women (high WC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-2.54), high BMI (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.58-2.74)) but not in men (high WC (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.86-1.64), high BMI (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.77-1.29)). Furthermore, combined measures of the two obesity indices and interaction analysis results revealed a synergistic association in men (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.33-1.85; relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) = 0.39, 95% CI = -0.09-0.86), and women (OR = 3.70, 95% CI = 3.09-4.43; RERI = 0.85, 95% CI = -0.06-1.75).  BMI and WC were significantly associated with a risk of elevated hs-CRP levels in women but not in men.

Deep learning-based MRI reconstruction enables image denoising with sharp edges and reduced artifacts, which improves the image quality of thin-slice MRI. Purpose To assess the diagnostic performance of 1-mm slice thickness MRI with deep learning-based reconstruction (DLR) (hereafter, 1-mm MRI+DLR) compared with 3-mm slice thickness MRI (hereafter, 3-mm MRI) for identifying residual tumor and cavernous sinus invasion in the evaluation of postoperative pituitary adenoma. Materials and Methods This single-institution retrospective study included 65 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 54 years ± 10; 26 women) who underwent a combined imaging protocol including 3-mm MRI and 1-mm MRI+DLR for postoperative evaluation of pituitary adenoma between August and October 2019. Reference standards for correct diagnosis were established by using all available imaging resources, clinical histories, laboratory findings, surgical records, and pathology reports. The diagnostic performances of 3-mm MRI, 1-mm slice thickness MRI without DLR (hereafter, 1-mm MRI), and 1-mm MRI+DLR for identifying residual tumor and cavernous sinus invasion were evaluated by two readers and compared between the protocols. Results The performance of 1-mm MRI+DLR in the identification of residual tumor was comparable to that of 3-mm MRI (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.89-0.92 vs 0.85-0.89, respectively;  ≥ .09). In the identification of cavernous sinus invasion, the diagnostic performance of 1-mm MRI+DLR was higher than that of 3-mm MRI (AUC, 0.95-0.98 vs 0.83-0.87, respectively;  ≤ .02). Conventional 1-mm MRI (AUC, 0.82-0.83) showed comparable diagnostic performance to 3-mm MRI (AUC, 0.83-0.87) ( ≥ .38). With 1-mm MRI+DLR, residual tumor was diagnosed in 20 patients and cavernous sinus invasion was diagnosed in 14 patients, in whom these diagnoses were not made with 3-mm MRI.

Here we show that the liver-enriched transcription factor CREBH is activated by TG accumulation and induces FGF21, which suppresses adipose tissue lipolysis, ameliorating hepatic steatosis. CREBH-deficient mice developed severe hepatic steatosis due to increased adipose tissue lipolysis, when fasted or fed a high-fat low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. FGF21 production was impaired in CREBH-deficient mice, and adenoviral overexpression of FGF21 suppressed adipose tissue lipolysis and improved hepatic steatosis in these mice.

Physical exercise can alleviate obesity-induced insulin resistance and T2DM, however, the precise mechanism for this outcome is not fully understood. The endocrine disorder of adipose tissue in obesity plays a critical role in the development of insulin resistance. In this regard, spexin has been recently described as an adipokine that plays an important role in the pathophysiology of obesity-induced insulin resistance and T2DM. In obese states, expression of adipose tissue spexin is reduced, inducing the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle more susceptible to insulin resistance. Emerging evidences point out that exercise can increase spexin expression. In return, spexin could exert the exercise-protective roles to ameliorate insulin resistance, suggesting that spexin is a potential mediator for exercise to ameliorate obesity-induced insulin resistance and T2DM, namely, the beneficial effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity is at least partly mediated by spexin. This review summarizes our and others' recent studies regarding the effects of obesity on adipose tissue spexin induction, along with the potential effect of exercise on this response in obese context, and provides a new insight into the multivariate relationship among exercise, spexin and T2DM. It should be therefore taken into account that a combination of spexin and exercise training is an effective therapeutic strategy for age-associated diseases.""), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The thiazolidinedione (TZD) moiety of lobeglitazone occupies the canonical ligand-binding pocket near the activation function-2 (AF-2) helix (i.e., helix H12) in ligand-binding domain as the TZD moiety of rosiglitazone does. However, the elongated p-methoxyphenol moiety of lobeglitazone interacts with the hydrophobic pocket near the alternate binding site of PPARγ. The extended interaction of lobeglitazone with the hydrophobic pocket enhances its binding affinity and could affect the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)-mediated phosphorylation of PPARγ at Ser245 (in PPARγ1 numbering; Ser273 in PPARγ2 numbering). Lobeglitazone inhibited the phosphorylation of PPARγ at Ser245 in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited a better inhibitory effect on Ser245 phosphorylation than rosiglitazone did.

In this study, we investigated the anti-diabetic effects of GN in C2C12 myotubes and HFD obese mice. GN enhanced the phosphorylation of AMPK/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and Akt. In addition, GN promoted glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes, which was accompanied by the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane. Treatment with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, suppressed GN-mediated stimulation of glucose uptake. Furthermore, GN increased the expression of mitochondria biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation genes in C2C12 myotubes. In the in\xa0vivo study, administration of GN to HFD mice decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose and insulin, and improved glucose tolerance in HFD obese mice.

Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an arylesterase with antioxidant activity, has been shown to play an important role in preventing the development of diabetes in transgenic mice. However, no studies have examined the anti-diabetic effect of PON1 delivered to beta cells using protein transduction. In this study, we expressed the cell-permeable PON1 fused with PEP-1 protein transduction domain (PEP-1-PON1) to investigate whether transduced PEP-1-PON1 protects beta cells against cytokine-induced cytotoxicity. PEP-1-PON1 was effectively delivered to INS-1 cells and prevented cytokine-induced cell destruction in a dose-dependent manner. Transduced PEP-1-PON1 significantly reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), DNA fragmentation, and expression of inflammatory mediators, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins, and apoptosis-related proteins in cytokine-treated cells. Moreover, transduced PEP-1-PON1 restored the decrease in basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion induced by cytokines. These data indicate that PEP-1-PON1 protects beta cells from cytokine-induced cytotoxicity by alleviating oxidative/nitrosative stress, ER stress, and inflammation.

After the SD period, the participants underwent treatment for 30 min by the assigned group [sleep supplement after SD (SSD), low-intensity aerobic exercise after SD (LES), moderate-intensity aerobic exercise after SD (MES), high-intensity aerobic exercise after SD (HES)]. For analysis, sleep-related factors were measured, and metabolites were analyzed by untargeted metabolite analysis using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. As a result, SD showed that total sleep time (TST), duration of rapid eye movement (REM), duration of light sleep, and duration of deep sleep were significantly decreased compared to NS, whereas the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and visual analogue scale (VAS) were significantly increased compared to NS. The difference in metabolites between NS and SD showed that there were significant changes in the seven metabolites. There were 18 metabolites that changed according to the treatment groups in SD conditions. In summary, SD can exacerbate sleep quality, induce daytime sleepiness, increase fatigue, and increase metabolites that cause insulin resistance. Aerobic exercise under SD conditions can reduce metabolites that induce insulin resistance and increase the metabolites that help relieve depression caused by SD.

The mechanisms of ARHL caused by atherosclerosis have not been previously determined in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) male mice. To investigate the onset and cause of the hearing loss, ApoE KO male mice were treated with a western diet (ApoE KO-WD) for 16 weeks. The lipid profile, atherosclerotic plaques throughout the aorta, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured in the ApoE KO-WD male mice. The expression of S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), a neuronal damage biomarker, was also observed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis rates were detected in the cochlea of the ApoE KO male mice. Atherosclerotic plaques on the aorta and ABR thresholds were significantly increased in the ApoE KO-WD male mice at 24 weeks of age. ABR thresholds had a statistically significant positive correlation with the area of atherosclerotic plaques (r\xa0=\xa00.783, p\xa0=\xa00.013) in male mice at 24 weeks of age.

Cells positive for active caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in the SGNs were significantly increased in ApoE KO-WD male mice indicating an increased rate of cellular apoptosis. In conclusion, ROS in the SGNs were activated by increased S100B expression in ApoE KO-WD male mice, and this resulted in an increased apoptosis rate. Thus, hearing loss began at 16 weeks in ApoE KO-WD male mice.

Pancreatic stellate cells are thought to be deeply involved in this islet fibrosis. In this process, the activation of RAS in islets is shown to transform quiescent pancreatic stellate cells into the activated form, stimulates their proliferation and consequently leads to islet fibrotic destruction.

For appropriately selected PTMC patients, AS can be a good management option and surgical intervention can be safely delayed until progression occurs. Many considerations must be taken into account at the time of initiation of AS, including radiological tumor characteristics and clinical characteristics of the patient. A specialized medical team should be assembled to monitor patients during AS with an appropriate follow-up protocol. The fact that some patients require surgery for disease progression after long-term follow-up is a major drawback of the current AS protocol.

The management of hyperglycemia starts with insulin or sulfonylurea, depending on the type, dose, and delivery of the glucocorticoid formulation. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are associated with a high incidence of hyperglycemia, ranging from 13% to 50%. Immunotherapy, such as anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody treatment, induces hyperglycemia with a prevalence of 0.1%.

Since high serum TgAb levels may also affect the fine needle aspiration washout Tg levels from suspicious lymph nodes of DTC patients, it is important to use caution when interpreting the washout Tg levels in patients who are positive for TgAb.')])"

Recent experiments demonstrated that lumican stimulates preosteoblast viability and differentiation, leading to bone formation. To further understand the role of lumican in bone metabolism, we investigated its effects on osteoclast biology. Lumican inhibited both osteoclast differentiation and in vitro bone resorption in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with this, lumican markedly decreased the expression of osteoclastogenesis markers. Moreover, the migration and fusion of preosteoclasts and the resorptive activity per osteoclast were significantly reduced in the presence of lumican, indicating that this protein affects most stages of osteoclastogenesis. Among RANKL-dependent pathways, lumican inhibited Akt but not MAP kinases such as JNK, p38, and ERK. Importantly, co-treatment with an Akt activator almost completely reversed the effect of lumican on osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our findings revealed that lumican inhibits osteoclastogenesis by suppressing Akt activity. Thus, lumican plays an osteoprotective role by simultaneously increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption, suggesting that it represents a dual-action therapeutic target for osteoporosis.')])"

Histological analysis revealed that the cross-sectional area of the tibialis anterior (TA) in the dulaglutide-treated group was thicker than that in the vehicle group. Moreover, dulaglutide increased the shift toward middle and large-sized fibers in both young and aged mice compared to the vehicle.

However, it is nearly impossible to avoid the exposure to these low-dose chemical mixtures as humans are exposed to a myriad of synthetic chemicals as a part of their daily lives. Therefore, coping with possible harms due to low dose chemical mixtures is challenging. Interestingly, within the range of environmental exposure, disease risk does not increase linearly with increasing dose of chemicals, but often tends to plateau or even decrease with increasing dose. Hormesis, the over-compensation of various adaptive responses through cellular stresses, is one possible mechanism for this non-linearity. Although the hormetic effects of synthetic chemicals or radiation have long been debated in the field of toxicology, the hormesis concept has recently been generalized in the field of molecular biology; similar to responses to synthetic chemicals, mild to moderate intermittent stressors from any source can induce hormetic responses. Examples of stressors are exercise, calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, cognitive stimulation, and phytochemicals. Mitohormesis is hormesis induced by such stressors through mitochondrial retrograde signalling including the increased production of mild reactive oxygen species. Xenohormesis is phytochemical-induced hormesis, reflective of a mutualistic relationship between plant and animals. As humans had repeated exposure to all of these stressors during their evolution, the hormetic effects of these health behaviours may be considered to be evolutionarily adapted. Although hormesis induced by synthetic chemicals occurs in humans, such hormesis may not be recommended to the public due to unresolved issues on safety including the impossibility of control exposure. However, the use of personal health behaviors which enhance mitohormetic- or xenohormetic-stress can be readily incorporated into everyone's daily lives as a practical way to counteract harmful effects of unavoidable low-dose chemical mixtures.""), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous work has suggested that inhibiting adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in adipose tissue during HF development may assist in the treatment of HF. The ability to specifically target the adipocyte as a potential treatment for HF is a novel approach that could significantly influence the management of HF in the future. Our objectives were to assess the cardiac structural and functional effects of pharmacological inhibition of ATGL in mice with HF, to assess whether ATGL inhibition works in an adipocyte-autonomous manner, and to determine the role that adiposity and glucose homeostasis play in this HF treatment approach. Using a known ATGL inhibitor, atglistatin, as well as mice with germline deletion of adipocyte-specific ATGL, we tested the effectiveness of ATGL inhibition in mice with pressure overload-induced HF. Here, we show that atglistatin can prevent the functional decline in HF and provide evidence that specifically targeting ATGL in the adipocyte is sufficient to prevent worsening of HF. We further demonstrate that the benefit resulting from atglistatin in HF is not dependent on previously suggested improvements in glucose homeostasis, nor are the benefits derived from increased adiposity.

According to the canonical view, temperature is sensed by cutaneous thermoreceptors and nerve impulses transmitted to the hypothalamus, which generates sympathetic signals to ß-adrenergic receptors in brown adipocytes. The energy for heat generation is primarily provided by the oxidation of fatty acids derived from triglyceride hydrolysis and cellular uptake. Fatty acids also activate the uncoupling protein, UCP1, which creates a proton leak that uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production, resulting in energy dissipation as heat. Recent evidence supports the idea that in response to mild cold, ß-adrenergic signals stimulate not only lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, but also act through the mTORC2-Akt signaling module to stimulate de novo lipogenesis. This opposing anabolic effect is thought to maintain lipid fuel stores during increased catabolism. We show here, using brown fat-specific Gs-alpha knockout mice and cultured adipocytes that, unlike mild cold, severe cold directly cools brown fat and bypasses ß-adrenergic signaling to inhibit mTORC2. This cell-autonomous effect both inhibits lipogenesis and augments UCP1 expression to enhance thermogenesis.

However, its role in the pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which TWEAK regulates inflammatory signaling in orbital fibroblasts from GO patients. We found that TWEAK and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFA) mRNA levels were upregulated in GO as compared to non-GO tissue samples. TWEAK, TNF receptor (TNFR)1, TNFR2, and TNFR superfamily member 12A mRNA, and TWEAK and Fn14 protein levels were increased by interleukin (IL)-1β and TNF-α treatment. Treatment with exogenous recombinant TWEAK increased the transcript and protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to a greater extent in GO than in non-GO cells, while treatment with the anti-Fn14 antibody ITEM4 suppressed TWEAK-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release and hyaluronan production. Additionally, the serum level of TWEAK was higher in Graves' disease patients with (341.86 ± 86.3 pg/ml) as compared to those without (294.09 ± 41.44 pg/ml) GO and healthy subjects (255.33 ± 39.38 pg/ml), and was positively correlated with clinical activity score (r = 0.629, P < 0.001) and thyroid binding immunoglobulin level (r = 0.659, P < 0.001).

The abundance and diversity of alkane-degrading genes were investigated, and these genes were integrated with reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Additionally, the association of functional genes and MAGs with respect to LAS degradation was investigated. The results showed that alkB and cytochrome P450 genes were only shared within specific MAGs. Unique sets of genes with diverse abundances were detected in each sample. The MAGs with the alkB and cytochrome P450 genes were strongly associated with the other MAGs and involved in positive commensal interactions.

AMPK is a crucial sensor of cellular bioenergetics for controlling anabolic and catabolic metabolism. Since AMPK is a direct regulator of tau phosphorylation, we hypothesized that strict diet control to achieve euglycaemia affects tau protein phosphorylation through increased AMPK activity in the hippocampus of DM rats. To test this hypothesis, we generated insulin-deficient DM rats by subtotal pancreatectomy and the animals were categorized into the diet-restriction (R) group and ad libitum (AL) feeding group.

Gene expression studies and luciferase reporter assays showed FMOD affected calcium channel gene expressions by regulating calcium channel gene promoter, and patch-clamp experiments showed both L- and T-type calcium channel currents were almost undetectable in FMOD knocked down cells. In addition, gene knock-down studies demonstrated the COL1α1 and Itm2a genes both regulate the expressions of calcium channel genes.

Purpose To investigate the performance of multiphasic CT in the assessment of longitudinal tumor extent, vascular invasion, and resectability of EHD cancer according to the Korean Society of Abdominal Radiology consensus recommendation and to evaluate the interreader agreement. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with EHD cancer who underwent multiphasic CT examinations with section thickness of 3 mm or less before surgery from January 2016 to December 2018. Four abdominal radiologists independently evaluated the overall and biliary segment-wise longitudinal tumor extent, the presence of hepatic artery and/or portal vein invasion, and the resectability according to the Korean Society of Abdominal Radiology recommendations. The diagnostic performance was assessed with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Interreader agreement was determined using κ statistics. Results A total of 112 patients (mean age ± SD, 61 years ± 11; 73 men) were evaluated. The accuracy of the overall longitudinal tumor extent assessment ranged from 56.3% (63 of 112 patients) to 74.1% (83 of 112 patients). The sensitivity for detecting secondary confluence involvement ( = 62) was lower than that for the primary confluence or intrapancreatic duct ( = 115; 38.5%-75% vs 72.1%-96.3%, respectively). Vascular invasion ( = 17) had moderate sensitivity (28.6%-71.4%) and high specificity (77.5%-99.0%). For predicting negative-margin (R0) resection ( = 85), the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 71.8% to 96.5% and from 11.1% to 66.7%, respectively, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.69 to 0.80.

However, its role in the development of human fungal pathogens remains unclear. To elucidate the role of the HAP complex in C. neoformans development, we constructed Δ, Δ, Δ, and Δ mutants and their complemented congenic α H99 and  YL99 strains. The HAP complex plays a conserved role in iron utilization and stress responses in cells of both mating types. Deletion of any of the HAP complex components markedly enhances filamentation during bisexual mating. However, the Hap2/3/5 complex, but not HapX, is crucial in repressing pheromone production and cell fusion and is thus a critical repressor of sexual differentiation of C. neoformans. Interestingly, deletion of the heterotrimeric complex transcriptionally regulated both positive and negative regulators in the pheromone-responsive Cpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the HAP complex physically bound to the CCAAT motif of the  and  promoter regions. Notably, the HAP complex was differentially localized depending on the mating type in basal conditions; it was enriched in the nuclei of α cells but diffused in the cytoplasm of  cells. Interestingly, however, a portion of the HAP complex in both mating types relocalized to the cell membrane during mating. In conclusion, the Hap2/3/5 heterotrimeric complex and HapX play major and minor roles, respectively, in repressing the sexual development of C. neoformans in association with the Cpk1 MAPK pathway.  Cryptococcus neoformans isolates are of two mating types: α strains, which are predominant, and  strains, isolated from the sub-Saharan African region, where cryptococcosis is most abundant and severe. Here, we demonstrated the function of the CCAAT-binding HAP complex (Hap2/3/5/X) as a transcriptional repressor of Cpk1 pathway-related genes in cells of both mating types. Deletion of any HAP complex component markedly enhanced filamentation without affecting normal sporulation. In particular, deletion of the DNA-binding HAP complex components (Hap2/3/5), but not HapX, markedly enhanced pheromone production and cell fusion efficiency, validating its repressive role in the early stage of mating in C. neoformans.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of astaxanthin and its antioxidant activity in the hippocampus of gerbils subjected to 15-min transient forebrain ischemia, which led to the massive loss (death) of pyramidal cells located in hippocampal cornu Ammonis 1-3 (CA1-3) subfields. Astaxanthin (100 mg/kg) was administered once daily for three days before the induction of transient ischemia. Treatment with astaxanthin significantly attenuated the ischemia-induced loss of pyramidal cells in CA1-3. In addition, treatment with astaxanthin significantly reduced ischemia-induced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation in CA1-3 pyramidal cells. Moreover, the expression of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2) in CA1-3 pyramidal cells were gradually and significantly reduced after ischemia. However, in astaxanthin-treated gerbils, the expression of SOD1 and SOD2 was significantly high compared to in-vehicle-treated gerbils before and after ischemia induction.

Methods Diabetic neuropathy was made in Sprague Dawley rats by streptozotocin. Pain threshold was evaluated using von Frey monofilaments for 24 weeks. On comparable experiment time after streptozotocin injection, all footpads were prepared for following procedures; glutathione assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling staining, immunohistochemistry staining, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot. Additionally, human HaCaT skin keratinocytes were treated with methylglyoxal, transfected with migration inhibitory factor/control small interfering RNA, and prepared for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Results As compared to sham group, pain threshold was significantly reduced in diabetic neuropathy group, and glutathione was decreased in footpad skin, simultaneously, cell death was increased. Over-expression of migration inhibitory factor, accompanied by low expression of glyoxalase-I and intraepidermal nerve fibers, was shown on the footpad skin lesions of diabetic neuropathy. But, there was no significance in expression of neurotransmitters and inflammatory mediators such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, mas-related G protein coupled receptor D, nuclear factor kappa B, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 between diabetic neuropathy group and sham group.

Our results suggested that Vav1 deficiency promoted the differentiation of BMMCs into OCs, as indicated by the increased expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, cathepsin K, and calcitonin receptor. Therefore, Vav1 may play a negative role in OC differentiation. This hypothesis was supported by the observation of more OCs in the femurs of Vav1-/- mice than in WT mice. Furthermore, the bone status of Vav1-/- mice was analyzed in situ and the femurs of Vav1-/- mice appeared abnormal, with poor bone density and fewer number of trabeculae. In addition, Vav1-deficient OCs showed stronger adhesion to vitronectin, an αvβ3 integrin ligand important in bone resorption.

Most clinical trials with DPP4 inhibitors have shown no inferiority compared with placebo treatments in terms of CV safety.

CV outcome trials with GLP1 receptor agonists showed inconsistent results: lixisenatide did not show benefits in preventing major adverse CV events. In contrast, liraglutide and semaglutide (longer acting GLP1 receptor agonists) proved to be superior in terms of alleviating CV morbidity and mortality. Two large-scale CV outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors showed significant results: empagliflozin proved to be superior in preventing CV and all-cause mortality, and canagliflozin proved to be superior in preventing CV mortality but not all-cause mortality. So far, controlling cardiometabolic risk factors such as hemodynamic changes and weight loss by SGLT2 inhibitors are suggested to be the main mechanisms for these results.

Here we report an insulin sensitizer thiazolidinedione Pioglitazone selectively preserves the beta cells against high glucose-induced dysfunction by activation of AMPK and Glutaminase 1 (GLS1) axis. AMPK activation increases the stability of Glutaminase 1 by HSP90 family mitochondrial heat shock protein 75 (HSP75/TRAP1). This is associated with an elevation of GSH/GSSG ratio which leads to inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction by induction of BCL2/BCL-XL in high glucose conditions. Pioglitazone was able to also protect against high glucose-induced elevations in maladaptive ER stress markers and increase the adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) by inhibiting mTORC1-eEF2 protein translation machinery. Moreover, the pioglitazone effect on AMPK activation was not dependent on the PPARγ pathway. Strikingly, chemical inhibition of AMPK signaling or glutaminase-1 inhibition abrogates the pioglitazone effect on the TRAP1-GLS1 axis and GSH/GSSG ratio linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, inhibition of AMPK signaling enhanced maladaptive ER stress markers by mTORC1-eEF2 activation. Altogether, these results support the proposal that pioglitazone induced AMPK activation stabilizes a novel interaction of TRAP1/HSP75-GLS1 and its downstream signaling leads to improved β-cell function and survival under high glucose conditions.'), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Despite the biological significance of these two glycosyltransferases involved in pathogenicity and avoidance of the host innate immune response, their structures and the molecular basis of their activity have not been investigated. This study reports the crystal structures of SdgB and SdgA from S. aureus as well as multiple structures of SdgB in complex with its substrates (for example UDP, N-acetylglucosamine or SDR peptides), products (glycosylated SDR peptides) or phosphate ions. Together with biophysical and biochemical analyses, this structural work uncovered the novel mechanism by which SdgB and SdgA carry out the glycosyl-transfer process to the long SDR region in SDR proteins. SdgB undergoes dynamic changes in its structure such as a transition from an open to a closed conformation upon ligand binding and takes diverse forms, both as a homodimer and as a heterodimer with SdgA. Overall, these findings not only elucidate the putative role of the three domains of SdgB in recognizing donor and acceptor substrates, but also provide new mechanistic insights into glycosylation of the SDR domain, which can serve as a starting point for the development of antibacterial drugs against staphylococcal infections.'), ('CopyrightInformation', 'open access.')])"

By interacting with LPHN2, LRG1 promotes both angiogenic and neurotrophic processes in mouse tissue explants under hyperglycemic conditions. Preclinical studies in a diabetic ED mouse model showed that LRG1 administration into the penile tissue, which exhibits significantly increased LPHN2 expression, fully restores erectile function by rescuing vascular and neurological abnormalities. Further investigations revealed that PI3K, AKT, and NF-κB p65 constitute the key intracellular signaling pathway of the LRG1/LPHN2 axis, providing important mechanistic insights into LRG1-mediated angiogenesis and nerve regeneration in DM. Our findings suggest that LRG1 can be a potential new therapeutic option for treating aberrant peripheral blood vessels and neuropathy associated with diabetic complications, such as diabetic ED.'), ('CopyrightInformation', '© 2022.

The present study was performed to test whether food intake is regulated by circulating FFAs in an oleate-specific manner. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of olive, safflower, or coconut oil (100mg/h), together with heparin, to raise circulating oleate, linoleate, or palmitate, respectively, and their effects on overnight food intake were evaluated. Compared to other oils, olive oil infusion showed a significantly greater effect to reduce food intake (P<0.01). Total caloric intake, the sum of the calories from the diet and infused oil, was significantly reduced with olive oil (P<0.01) but not with coconut or safflower oil infusion, suggesting an oleate-specific effect on caloric intake. To further test this idea, different groups of rats received an intravenous infusion of oleate, linoleate, or octanoate (0.5mg/h). Oleate infusion decreased overnight food intake by 26% (P<0.001), but no significant effect was seen with linoleate, octanoate, or vehicle infusion (P>0.05). The effects of olive oil or oleate infusion could not be explained by changes in plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, or total FFA levels. The olive oil effect on food intake was not reduced in vagotomized rats, suggesting that oleate sensing may not involve peripheral sensors. In contrast, olive oil's effect was attenuated in high-fat-fed rats, suggesting that this effect is regulated (or impaired) under physiological (or pathological) conditions. Taken together, the present study provides evidence that circulating oleate is sensed by the brain differentially from other FFAs to control feeding in rats.""), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Similarly to nonsteroid-related DM, the principles of early detection and risk factor modification apply. Screening for GIDM should be considered in all patients treated with medium to high doses of glucocorticoids. Challenges in the management of GIDM stem from wide fluctuations in postprandial hyperglycemia and the lack of clearly defined treatment protocols. Together with lifestyle measures, hypoglycemic drugs with insulin-sensitizing effects are indicated.

HI was defined as one or more episodes of systolic blood pressure\u2009>\u2009200\xa0mmHg or mean blood pressure\u2009<\u200960\xa0mmHg during surgery. The factors predictive of perioperative HI were determined using both univariate and multivariate analyses. Intraoperative HI occurred in 79 (69.3%) patients. In multivariate analysis, α-adrenergic receptor blocker duration (days) (odds ratio, 1.015; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.029) was a predictor for intraoperative HI. Postoperative hypotension occurred in 36 (31.6%) patients. Higher urine epinephrine levels, and greater preoperative highest heart rate (HR) were predictive factors for postoperative hypotension in PPGL patients.

To mitigate this problem, this study proposes a novel real-time learning (RTL) approach to estimate PM with aerodynamic diameters of <10\xa0μm (PM) and <2.5\xa0μm (PM) using hourly aerosol data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and numerical model outputs for daytime conditions over Northeast Asia. Three schemes with different weighting strategies were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation (CV). The RTL models, which considered both concentration and time as weighting factors (i.e., Scheme 3) yielded consistent improvement for 10-fold CV performance on both hourly and monthly scales. The real-time calibration results for PM and PM were R\xa0=\xa00.97 and 0.96, and relative root mean square error (rRMSE)\xa0=\xa012.1% and 12.0%, respectively, and the 10-fold CV results for PM and PM were R\xa0=\xa00.73 and 0.69 and rRMSE\xa0=\xa041.8% and 39.6%, respectively. These results were superior to results from the offline models in previous studies, which were based on historical data on an hourly scale. Moreover, we estimated PM concentrations in the ocean without using land-based variables, and clearly demonstrated the PM transport over time. Because the proposed models are based on the RTL approach, the density of in-situ monitoring sites could be a major uncertainty factor.

However, recent studies have shown that estrogen suppresses apoptosis by inhibiting ER stress in some cell types, suggesting that ER stress-induced apoptosis is regulated by ovarian steroid hormones. In endometrial cells, ER stress may also be controlled by ovarian steroid hormones and could be involved in apoptosis induction during the menstrual cycle. To test this hypothesis, we elucidate whether ER stress is regulated by ovarian steroid hormones in human endometrial cells and if it is involved in apoptosis induction. Specifically, we sought to determine the effects of estrogen and progesterone on the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway, a pro-apoptotic pathway mediated by ER stress. Our results show that ER stress maker GRP78 expression was increased in human endometrial Ishikawa and endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) treated with tunicamycin. Addition of estrogen decreased tunicamycin-induced GRP78 expression. In contrast, progesterone treatment increased GRP78 in estrogen-treated Ishikawa and ESCs, which significantly increased CHOP expression through phosphorylation of eIF2α and upregulation of ATF4. This upregulation was accompanied by an increased apoptosis induction. The progesterone-induced increase in apoptosis was reversed by either mifepristone (progesterone receptor modulator) or salubrinal (ER stress inhibitor). Furthermore, our  results also showed that GRP78, CHOP expression and apoptosis were significantly increased in endometrial cells during the secretory phase as well as by  treatment with progesterone.

Aβ is derived from amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, AβPP is cleaved by α-secretase and γ-secretase at the plasma membrane, excluding Aβ production. Alternatively, AβPP in the plasma membrane is internalized via endocytosis, and delivered to early endosomes and lysosomes, where it is cleaved by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Recent studies have shown that insulin in the periphery crosses the blood-brain barrier, and plays important roles in the brain. Furthermore, impaired insulin signaling has been linked to the progression of AD, and intranasal insulin administration improves memory impairments and cognition. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of insulin treatment remain largely unknown. To investigate the effects of insulin on AβPP processing, we tested the effects of insulin on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing AβPP, and cultured rat cortical neurons. We found that insulin increased the level of cell surface AβPP, decreasing the endocytosis rate of AβPP. Insulin reduced Aβ generation through upregulation of AβPP O-GlcNAcylation via Akt insulin signaling. Our present data suggest that insulin affects Aβ production by regulating AβPP processing through AβPP O-GlcNAcylation. These results provide mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of insulin, and a possible link between insulin deficient diabetes and cerebral amyloidosis in the pathogenesis of AD."")])"

There have been conflicting reports regarding an association between metformin and cancer risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between metformin use and the incidence of cancer in Koreans with T2DM.Data from The Korean National Diabetes Program (KNDP, 2006-2014), a nationwide, large-scale, prospective, multicenter cohort study in Korea, were used to study patients with T2DM.

Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) is an important biological lipid that can be converted to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by autotaxin. S1P is known to be involved in osteoclast activation by stimulating osteoblasts, but bone regulation by SPC is not well understood. In this study, we found that SPC strongly inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. SPC-induced inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation were not affected by several antagonists of S1P receptors or pertussis toxin, suggesting cell surface receptor independency. However, SPC inhibited RANKL-induced calcineurin activation and subsequent NFATc1 activity, leading to decrease of the expression of Trap and Ctsk. Moreover, we found that bone loss in an experimental osteoporosis mouse model was recovered by SPC injection. SPC also blocked ovariectomy-induced body weight increase and Nfatc1 gene expression in mice. We also found that SPC inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in human macrophages. Since currently available treatments for osteoporosis, such as administration of female hormones or hormone receptor modulators, show serious side effects, SPC has potential as a new agent for osteoporosis treatment.'), ('CopyrightInformation', '© 2020 The Authors.

Here, we aimed to investigate the structure and dynamics of the Csp of psychrophile Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H, ( Cp-Csp). Although Cp-Csp shares sequence homology, common folding patterns, and motifs, including a five β-stranded barrel, with its thermophilic counterparts, its thermostability (37 °C) was markedly lower than those of other Csps. Cp-Csp binds heptathymidine with an affinity of 10 M, thereby increasing its thermostability to 50 °C. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of the Cp-Csp structure and backbone dynamics revealed a flexible structure with only one salt bridge and 10 residues in the hydrophobic cavity. Notably, Cp-Csp contains Tyr51 instead of the conserved Phe in the hydrophobic core, and its phenolic hydroxyl group projects toward the surface. The Y51F mutation increased the stability of hydrophobic packing and may have allowed for the formation of a K3-E21 salt bridge, thereby increasing its thermostability to 43 °C. Cp-Csp exhibited conformational exchanges in its ribonucleoprotein motifs 1 and 2 (754 and 642 s), and heptathymidine binding markedly decreased these motions. Cp-Csp lacks salt bridges and has longer flexible loops and a less compact hydrophobic cavity resulting from Tyr51 compared to mesophilic and thermophilic Csps. These might explain the low thermostability of Cp-Csp. The conformational flexibility of Cp-Csp facilitates its accommodation of nucleic acids at low temperatures in polar oceans and its function as an RNA chaperone for cold adaptation.')]))])"
31676768,diabetes,Hepatic triglyceride accumulation via endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced SREBP-1 activation is regulated by ceramide synthases.,"OrderedDict([('AbstractText', 'The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is not only important for protein synthesis and folding but is also crucial for lipid synthesis and metabolism. In the current study, we demonstrate an important role of ceramide synthases (CerS) in ER stress and NAFLD progression. Ceramide is important in sphingolipid metabolism, and its acyl chain length is determined by a family of six CerS in mammals. CerS2 generates C22-C24 ceramides, and CerS5 or CerS6 produces C16 ceramide. To gain insight into the role of CerS in NAFLD, we used a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. Decreased levels of CerS2 and increased levels of CerS6 were observed in the steatotic livers of mice fed a HFD. In vitro experiments with Hep3B cells indicated the protective role of CerS2 and the detrimental role of CerS6 in the ER stress response induced by palmitate treatment. In particular, CerS6 overexpression increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) cleavage with decreased levels of INSIG-1, leading to increased lipogenesis. Blocking ER stress abrogated the detrimental effects of CerS6 on palmitate-induced SREBP-1 cleavage. In accordance with the protective role of CerS2 in the palmitate-induced ER stress response, CerS2 knockdown enhanced ER stress and SREBP-1 cleavage, and CerS2 heterozygote livers exhibited a stronger ER stress response and higher triglyceride levels following HFD. Finally, treatment with a low dose of bortezomib increased hepatic CerS2 expression and protected the development of NAFLD following HFD. These results indicate that CerS and its derivatives impact hepatic ER stress and lipogenesis differently and might be therapeutic targets for NAFLD.')])"

Moreover, S. aureus develops significant CP resistance after pretreatment with free CP, whereas the initial CP sensitivity is maintained after pretreatment with β-CD-MCM-CP at pH 7.4. However, β-CD-MCM-MX exhibits no such pH-responsive activity against Bacteroides fragilis, probably due to the insufficient stability of the MX conjugation at pH 7.4.

In multivariate analysis, PD duration, age at study entry and depression were significant risk factors for cognitive dysfunction as assessed by MMSE performance or the MoCA. In linear regression analysis of the association between MMSE Z scores and PD duration, there was no significant difference associated with the LRRK2 G2385R genotype.
