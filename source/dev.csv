The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis if TMAO is associated with the reduction of cardiovascular disease in the Korean obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery. From a subgroup of a multicenter, nonrandomized, controlled trial, titled KOBESS, 38 obese patients, 18 with and 20 without T2DM, who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were investigated. Bariatric surgery is indicated for Korean patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m or for Korean patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m who have comorbidities. Serum levels of TMAO and its precursors, betaine, carnitine, and choline were measured before and six months after bariatric surgery. The levels of TMAO and its precursors did not differ between obese patients with T2DM and non-T2DM at baseline. However, TMAO increased more than twofold in patients with T2DM after RYGB surgery, but not in patients without T2DM. Choline levels were decreased by half in all patients after RYGB. In patients with T2DM who underwent SG, TMAO, betaine, and carnitine levels did not change after the surgery. Furthermore, in obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery, increased TMAO levels were associated with both T2DM and RYGB, while reduced choline levels were associated with RYGB. These associations need to be further elucidated in follow-up studies to gain further insights into the relationship between TMAO levels and bariatric surgery outcomes.')]))])"

Evidence has shown a role for autophagy in tumor cell survival, but the molecular determinants that define sensitivity against autophagic regulation in cancers are not clear. Importantly, we found that breast cancer cells with low expression levels of a zinc-finger protein, ZNF143 (MCF7 sh-ZNF143), showed better survival than control cells (MCF7 sh-Control) under starvation, which was compromised with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor. In addition, there were more autophagic vesicles in MCF7 sh-ZNF143 cells than in MCF7 sh-Control cells, and proteins related with the autophagic process, such as Beclin1, p62, and ATGs, were altered in cells with less ZNF143. ZNF143 knockdown affected the stability of p53, which showed a dependence on MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Data from proteome profiling in breast cancer cells with less ZNF143 suggest a role of NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1(NQO1) for p53 stability. Taken together, we showed that a subset of breast cancer cells with low expression of ZNF143 might exhibit better survival via an autophagic process by regulating the p53⁻Beclin1 axis, corroborating the necessity of blocking autophagy for the best therapy.')])"

This article provides transcriptomic insights into the interaction between BRAFV600E and TERT promoter mutations mediated by ETS factors in PTC. RNA sequencing data on 266 PTCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 65 PTCs from our institute were analyzed for gene expression changes and related molecular pathways, and the results of transcriptomic analyses were validated by in vitro experiments.

In the ETS family of transcription factors, ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5 were upregulated by the BRAFV600E/MAPK pathway activation. These BRAFV600E-induced ETS factors selectively bound to the mutant TERT promoter. The molecular pathways activated by BRAFV600E were further augmented by adding the TERT promoter mutation, and the pathways related to immune responses or adhesion molecules were upregulated by TERT expression. The mechanism of the synergistic effect between BRAFV600E and TERT promoter mutations on cancer invasiveness and progression in PTC may be explained by increased TERT expression, which may result from the BRAF-induced upregulation of several ETS transcription factors.')])"

Overexpression of ERRγ specially increased fibrinogen expression in human hepatoma cell line. Cannabinoid receptor types 1(CB1R) agonist arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA) up-regulated transcription of fibrinogen via induction of ERRγ, whereas knockdown of ERRγ attenuated fibrinogen expression. Deletion analyses of the fibrinogen γ (FGG) gene promoter and ChIP assays revealed binding sites of ERRγ on human fibrinogen γ gene promoter. Moreover, overexpression of ERRγ was sufficient to increase fibrinogen gene expression, whereas treatment with GSK5182, a selective inverse agonist of ERRγ led to its attenuation in cell culture. Finally, fibrinogen and ERRγ gene expression were elevated in liver tissue of obese patients suggesting a conservation of this mechanism.

Integration of PFD clearly improved islet viability and decreased reactive oxygen species production compared to islets encapsulated with alginate only (alginate) and naked islets exposed to hypoxia in vitro. In PFD-alginate capsules, HIF-1α expression was minimal, and insulin expression was well maintained. Furthermore, the best islet function represented by glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was observed for the PFD-alginate capsules in hypoxic condition. For the in vivo study, the same number of naked islets and encapsulated islets (alginate and PFD-alginate) was transplanted into streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Nonfasting blood glucose levels and the area under the curve for glucose based on intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests in the PFD-alginate group were lower than in the alginate group.

In addition, PaPE-1 significantly increased the expression of mitochondrial genes, particularly ones associated with the electron transport chain, suggesting an increase in energy expenditure. Integrated pathway analysis using transcriptomics and metabolomics data showed that PaPE-1 treatment lowered inflammation, collagen deposition, and pathways regulating fatty acid metabolism and increased metabolites associated with glutathione metabolism. Overall, our findings support a beneficial metabolic role for PaPE-1 and suggest that PaPE-1 may protect postmenopausal women from fatty liver disease without increasing reproductive cancer risk.')])"

Here, we showed that Pref-1 induces insulin synthesis and secretion via two independent pathways. The overexpression of Pref-1 activated MAPK signaling, which induced nucleocytoplasmic translocation of FOXO1 and PDX1 and led to the differentiation of human pancreatic ductal cells into β-like cells and an increase in insulin synthesis. Concurrently, Pref-1 activated Akt signaling and facilitated insulin secretion. A proteomics analysis identified the Rab43 GTPase-activating protein as a downstream target of Akt. A serial activation of both proteins induced various granular protein syntheses which led to enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In a pancreatectomised diabetic animal model, exogenous Pref-1 improved glucose homeostasis by accelerating pancreatic ductal and β-cell regeneration after injury.

High-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) and genetically obese diabetic db/db mice treated with MSM (1%-5% v/v, by drinking water) were studied.

Concurrently, MSM reduces hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents in DIO mice. These effects are accompanied by reductions in gene expression of key molecules involved in lipogenesis and inflammation. FACS analysis reveals that MSM markedly increases the frequency of B cells and decreases the frequency of myeloid cells in peripheral blood and in bone marrow. Moreover, overnutrition-induced changes of femur microarchitecture are restored by MSM. In db/db mice, a marked impairment in glucose and lipid metabolic profiles is notably ameliorated when MSM is supplemented.

Glabridin effectively suppressed TCDD-induced loss of lipid accumulation in this model. Pretreating cells with glabridin increased the gene expression of not only the adipogenesis-associated key transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, but also lipoprotein lipase in the presence of TCDD. TCDD decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which was effectively restored by pretreatment with glabridin.

For in vitro studies of autophagy and inflammasomes, primary mouse hepatocytes, human hepatoma cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts with Ampk or Tsc2 knockout, and human or primary mouse macrophages were treated with ezetimibe and palmitate. Steatohepatitis and fibrosis were induced by feeding Atg7 wild-type, haploinsufficient, and knockout mice a methionine- and choline-deficient diet with ezetimibe (10\xa0mg/kg) for 4\xa0wk. Human livers with steatosis or NASH presented impaired autophagy with decreased nuclear TFEB and increased SQSTM1, MAP1LC3-II, and NLRP3 expression.

Ezetimibe induced AMPK phosphorylation and subsequent TFEB nuclear translocation, related to MAPK/ERK. In macrophages, ezetimibe blocked the NLRP3 inflammasome-IL1B pathway in an autophagy-dependent manner and modulated hepatocyte-macrophage interaction via extracellular vesicles.

It was observed that the Continuous group (continuous release of growth factors) provides a better environment for the osteogenic differentiation of hPDCs than the Biomimetic group (biomimetic release of growth factors), and thus is anticipated to promote bone regeneration. However, contrary to expectation, the Biomimetic group promoted significant new bone formation compared to the Continuous group. From the systematic cell culture experiments, the initial supply of VEGF was considered to have more favorable effects on the osteoclastogenesis than osteogenesis, which may hinder bone regeneration. Our results indicated that the continuous supply of VEGF (in particular, at early stage) from VEGF-loaded biomaterial might not be conducive to new bone formation. Therefore, we suggest that a biomimetic supply of growth factors is a more pivotal parameter for sufficient tissue regeneration.

Such periodicity is critical for homeostasis because disruption or misalignment of the intrinsic rhythms is associated with the onset and progression of various human diseases and often directly leads to pathological states. Since the first identification of mammalian circadian clock genes, numerous genetic and biochemical studies have revealed the molecular basis of these cell-autonomous and self-sustainable rhythms. Specifically, these rhythms are generated by two interlocking transcription/translation feedback loops of clock proteins. As our understanding of these underlying mechanisms and their functional outputs has expanded, strategies have emerged to pharmacologically control the circadian molecular clock. Small molecules that target the molecular clock may present novel therapeutic strategies to treat chronic circadian rhythm-related diseases. These pharmaceutical approaches may include the development of new drugs to treat circadian clock-related disorders or combinational use with existing therapeutic strategies to improve efficacy via intrinsic clock-dependent mechanisms. Importantly, circadian rhythm disruptions correlate with, and often precede, many symptoms of various neuropsychiatric disorders such as sleep disorders, affective disorders, addiction-related disorders, and neurodegeneration.

The injection of a soft-tissue filler into the subcutaneous fat tissue is recommended for treating mild indentations around the orbital rim and nasojugal region. Reducing the tethering effect of ligamentous structures by undermining using a cannula prior to the filler injection is recommended for treating relatively deep and fine indentations.

However, it is nearly impossible to avoid the exposure to these low-dose chemical mixtures as humans are exposed to a myriad of synthetic chemicals as a part of their daily lives. Therefore, coping with possible harms due to low dose chemical mixtures is challenging. Interestingly, within the range of environmental exposure, disease risk does not increase linearly with increasing dose of chemicals, but often tends to plateau or even decrease with increasing dose. Hormesis, the over-compensation of various adaptive responses through cellular stresses, is one possible mechanism for this non-linearity. Although the hormetic effects of synthetic chemicals or radiation have long been debated in the field of toxicology, the hormesis concept has recently been generalized in the field of molecular biology; similar to responses to synthetic chemicals, mild to moderate intermittent stressors from any source can induce hormetic responses. Examples of stressors are exercise, calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, cognitive stimulation, and phytochemicals. Mitohormesis is hormesis induced by such stressors through mitochondrial retrograde signalling including the increased production of mild reactive oxygen species. Xenohormesis is phytochemical-induced hormesis, reflective of a mutualistic relationship between plant and animals. As humans had repeated exposure to all of these stressors during their evolution, the hormetic effects of these health behaviours may be considered to be evolutionarily adapted. Although hormesis induced by synthetic chemicals occurs in humans, such hormesis may not be recommended to the public due to unresolved issues on safety including the impossibility of control exposure. However, the use of personal health behaviors which enhance mitohormetic- or xenohormetic-stress can be readily incorporated into everyone's daily lives as a practical way to counteract harmful effects of unavoidable low-dose chemical mixtures.""), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The isolated follicles from mouse ovaries were randomly divided into two-dimensional (2D) culture, alginate and ES-hydrogel, and just seeded on culture wells (2D culture) or encapsulated with alginate or ES-hydrogel (3D culture). Culture media from each group were collected on days 4, 8 and 10 or 11 for 17ß-oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) measurement. On day 10 of in\xa0vitro culture, follicular survival and pseudo-antrum formation rate were examined, and oocyte maturation was induced by adding human chorionic gonadotropin and epidermal growth factor. After 17\xa0h, ovulated mature oocytes collected and analyzed for oocyte diameter, normal spindle and chromosome alignment configuration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and mitochondrial membrane potential level. To compare mechanical properties of two biomaterials, storage modulus was measured with the advanced rheometric expansion system. Our results showed that follicles cultured in ES-hydrogel, were significantly superior to those cultured 2D or alginate in the pseudo-antrum formation rate, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) rate, MII oocyte rate, normal spindle rate, and E2 production. The ES-hydrogel and alginate groups were not significantly different in follicle survival rate, oocyte diameter, P4 production, ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential levels. The storage modulus of ES-hydrogel was lower than that of alginate, suggesting that the improved follicular physiology and oocyte maturation in the ES-hydrogel group was due to better hormone exchange through a less stiff encapsulating material. This study shows that 3D culture system using ES-hydrogel effectively improve the outcome of in\xa0vitro ovarian follicle culture, supporting follicle morphology and growth and enhancing oocyte maturation.

Here, we show that hepatic RORα controls lipid homeostasis by negatively regulating transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) that mediates hepatic lipid metabolism. Liver-specific Rorα-deficient mice develop hepatic steatosis, obesity and insulin resistance when challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD). Global transcriptome analysis reveals that liver-specific deletion of Rorα leads to the dysregulation of PPARγ signaling and increases hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. RORα specifically binds and recruits histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to PPARγ target promoters for the transcriptional repression of PPARγ. PPARγ antagonism restores metabolic homeostasis in HFD-fed liver-specific Rorα deficient mice. Our data indicate that RORα has a pivotal role in the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. Therapeutic strategies designed to modulate RORα activity may be beneficial for the treatment of metabolic disorders.Hepatic steatosis development may result from dysregulation of lipid metabolism, which is finely tuned by several transcription factors including the PPAR family.

Fixed ADC threshold methods may not be accurate because ADC values vary over time after stroke onset. Deep learning has the potential to improve the accuracy, provided that a large set of correctly annotated lesion data is used for training. The purpose of this study was to evaluate deep learning-based methods and compare them with commercial software in terms of lesion volume measurements. Methods- U-net, an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, was adopted to train segmentation models. Two U-net models were developed: a U-net (DWI+ADC) model, trained on DWI and ADC data, and a U-net (DWI) model, trained on DWI data only. A total of 296 subjects were used for training and 134 for external validation. An expert neurologist manually delineated the stroke lesions on DWI images, which were used as the ground-truth reference. Lesion volume measurements from the U-net methods were compared against the expert's manual segmentation and Rapid Processing of Perfusion and Diffusion (RAPID; iSchemaView Inc) analysis. Results- In external validation, U-net (DWI+ADC) showed the highest intraclass correlation coefficient with manual segmentation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00) and sufficiently high correlation with the RAPID results (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99). U-net (DWI+ADC) and manual segmentation resulted in the smallest 95% Bland-Altman limits of agreement (-5.31 to 4.93 mL) with a mean difference of -0.19 mL. Conclusions- The presented deep learning-based method is fully automatic and shows a high correlation of diffusion lesion volume measurements with manual segmentation and commercial software.

To reduce acidification by degradation of synthetic polymers, we incorporated magnesium hydroxide (MH) nanoparticles into porous polymer scaffold not only to effectively neutralize the acidic hydrolysate but also to minimize the structural disturbance of scaffolds. The neutralization effect of poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid; PLGA)/MH scaffold was confirmed with the maintenance of neutral pH, contrary to a PLGA scaffold with low pH. Further, the scaffolds were applied to evaluate the chondrogenic differentiation of the human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. In in vitro study, the PLGA/MH scaffold enhanced the chondrogenesis markers and reduced the calcification, compared to the PLGA scaffold. Additionally, the PLGA/MH scaffold reduced the release of inflammatory cytokines, compared to the PLGA scaffold, as the cell death decreased. Moreover, the addition of MH reduced necrotic cell death at the early stage of chondrogenic differentiation. Further, the necrotic cell death by the PLGA scaffold was mediated by cleavage of caspase-1, the so-called interleukin 1-converting enzyme, and MH alleviated it as well as nuclear factor kappa B expression.

On the other hand, TGZ caused a more prominent shift to glycolytic metabolism and was more cytotoxic in T47D cells. Both effects of TGZ on T47D cells were dose‑dependently reversed by addition of methyl pyruvate (mPyr), indicating suppression of mitochondrial pyruvate availability. Furthermore, UK5099, a specific mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitor, closely simulated the metabolic and antitumor effects of TGZ and their reversal by mPyr. This was accompanied by a substantial reduction of activated p70S6K. In CT26 cells, UK5099 did not reduce activated p70S6K and only modestly decreased cell proliferation. In these cells, combining glutamine restriction with UK5099 further increased glucose uptake and completely suppressed cell proliferation.

Although the prevalence of sympathetic and parasympathetic neuropathy is similar in T1DM versus T2DM patients, sympathetic nerve function correlates with parasympathetic neuropathy only in T1DM patients. The explanation for these discrepancies might be that parasympathetic nerve function was more severely affected among T2DM patients. As parasympathetic nerve damage seems to be more advanced than sympathetic nerve damage, it might be that parasympathetic neuropathy precedes sympathetic neuropathy in T2DM, which was Ewing's concept. This could be explained by the intrinsic morphologic difference.

Nevertheless, preclinical and limited clinical data suggest the potential protective effect of incretin-based agents against DN and DR via their anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiapoptotic properties.

We now confirm that THRSP overexpression in male mice reproduces behavioral features of ADHD, including sustained inattention and memory impairment, accompanied by excessive theta waves that were found normal in both the THRSP-knockout and hetero groups. Physiological characterization revealed low striatal T3 levels in the THRSP OE mice due to reduced striatal T3-specific monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), indicating brain-specific hypothyroidism in this transgenic mouse strain.

ANOVA (F-test) was used to evaluate the association between vitamin D level and degree of NAFLD, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used for survival analyses.  Vitamin D levels for normal, mild, moderate and severe steatosis were 25.1 ± 0.29 ng/mL, 24.7 ± 0.42 ng/mL, 23.7 ± 0.37 ng/mL and 23.6 ± 0.60 ng/mL, respectively (trend  < 0.001).

SIRT1 deacetylase maintains energy balance during fasting by directly activating both hepatic gluconeogenic and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation genes, but the underlying epigenetic and gene-specific mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, JMJD3 was identified unexpectedly as a gene-specific transcriptional partner of SIRT1 and epigenetically activated mitochondrial β-oxidation, but not gluconeogenic, genes during fasting. Mechanistically, JMJD3, together with SIRT1 and the nuclear receptor PPARα, formed a positive autoregulatory loop upon fasting-activated PKA signaling and epigenetically activated β-oxidation-promoting genes, including Fgf21, Cpt1a, and Mcad. Liver-specific downregulation of JMJD3 resulted in intrinsic defects in β-oxidation, which contributed to hepatosteatosis as well as glucose and insulin intolerance. Remarkably, the lipid-lowering effects by JMJD3 or SIRT1 in diet-induced obese mice were mutually interdependent.

To the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrated for the first time that LS may promote osteoblast differentiation and suppress osteoclast differentiation in vitro, and that it inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced bone loss in a mouse model. LS was observed to promote the osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3‑E1 cells and upregulate the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a key gene involved in osteoblast differentiation. This resulted in the induction of the expression of various osteogenic genes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteonectin (OSN), osteopontin (OPN), type I collagen (COL1) and bone sialoprotein (BSP). LS was also observed to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. The expression levels of nuclear factor of activated T‑cells 1 (NFATc1) and c‑Fos were inhibited following LS treatment. NFATc1 and c‑Fos are key markers of osteoclast differentiation that inhibit receptor activator of nuclear factor‑κΒ ligand (RANKL)‑induced mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPKs) and nuclear factor (NF)‑κB. As a result, LS suppressed the expression of osteoclast‑associated genes, such as matrix metallopeptidase‑9 (MMP‑9), cathepsin K (Ctsk), tartrate‑resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), osteoclast‑associated immunoglobulin‑like receptor (OSCAR), c‑src, c‑myc, osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC‑STAMP) and ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit d2 (ATP6v0d2).

Fatty liver disease was diagnosed using ultrasound, discrimination capability was assessed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and evaluation measures, including sensitivity and specificity, were calculated. Multiple logistic analyses were also performed.We calculated a self-assessed risk score for diabetes (range: 0-11), and a cutoff of ≥5 identified 60% (50%) of men (women) at high risk for NAFLD, reflecting a sensitivity of 79% (85%), a specificity of 60% (66%), a positive predictive value (PPV) of 68% (51%), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 73% (91%), with an AUC of 0.75 (0.82) for men (women). A cutoff point of ≥6 identified 43% (31%) of men (women) at high risk for NASH, reflecting a sensitivity of 80% (86%), a specificity of 64% (75%), a PPV of 30% (28%), and a NPV of 94% (98%), with an AUC of 0.77 (0.86) for men (women). The odds ratios that a 1-point increase in the diabetes risk scores would be associated with an increased risk for NAFLD and NASH were 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-1.25] and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.49-1.65), respectively, in men, and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.21-1.34) and 1.89 (95% CI: 1.73-2.07), respectively, in women.The present study indicates that our self-assessment risk score for diabetes could be an effective primary screening tool for the presence of NAFLD or NASH.')])"

Deletion and mutation analyses of the Srebp-1c gene promoter showed that ERRγ directly regulates Srebp-1c gene transcription via binding to an ERR-response element. Overexpression of ERRγ significantly induced SREBP-1c expression and fat accumulation in liver of mice, which were blocked in Srebp-1c-knockout hepatocytes. Conversely, liver-specific ablation of ERRγ gene expression attenuated alcohol-mediated induction of SREBP-1c expression. Finally, an ERRγ inverse agonist, GSK5182, significantly ameliorates fatty liver disease in chronically alcohol-fed mice through inhibition of SREBP-1c-mediated fat accumulation. ERRγ mediates alcohol-induced hepatic lipogenesis by upregulating SREBP-1c expression, which can be blunted by the inverse agonist for ERRγ, which may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of alcoholic fatty liver disease in human.')])), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Prostate cancer cells frequently spread to bone and secrete soluble signaling factors to accelerate osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. However, processes and mechanisms that govern the expression of osteoclastogenic soluble factors secreted by prostate cancer cells are largely unknown. MacroH2A (mH2A) is a histone variant that replaces canonical H2A at designated genomic loci and establishes functionally distinct chromatin regions. Here, we report that mH2A1.2, one of the mH2A isoforms, attenuates prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis by maintaining the inactive state of genes encoding soluble factors in prostate cancer cells. Our functional analyses of soluble factors identify lymphotoxin beta (LTβ) as a major stimulator of osteoclastogenesis and an essential mH2A1.2 target for its anti-osteoclastogenic activity. Mechanistically, mH2A1.2 directly interacts with HP1α and H1.2 and requires them to inactivate LTβ gene in prostate cancer cells. Consistently, HP1α and H1.2 have an intrinsic ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in a mH2A1.2-dependent manner. Together, our data uncover a new and specific role for mH2A1.2 in modulating osteoclastogenic potential of prostate cancer cells and demonstrate how this signaling pathway can be exploited to treat osteolytic bone metastases at the molecular level.')])"

The active site, in which a PLP molecule was found, is too small to accommodate a phospho-cofilin peptide, the substrate of chronophin. A conformational change to a cap-open conformation may be required for substrate binding. The core and cap domains are joined through linker peptide hinges that change conformation to open the active site. The crystal structures reveal that a disulphide bond between the cap and core domains restricts the hinge motion. The enzyme displays PLP dephosphorylation activity in the cap-closed conformation with the disulphide bond and even in the crystal state, in which repositioning of the cap and core domains is restricted. Structural analysis suggests that a small substrate such as PLP can bind to the active site through a small movement of a local motif.

For example, the alternate day fasting model, often used as a rodent IF regimen, can result in underfeeding, suggesting that health benefits from this intervention are likely mediated via both caloric restriction and fasting-refeeding cycles. Recently, it has been successfully demonstrated that 2:1 IF, comprising 1 day of fasting followed by 2 days of feeding, can provide protection against diet-induced obesity and metabolic improvements without a reduction in overall caloric intake. Presented here is a protocol of this isocaloric 2:1 IF intervention in mice.

We examined the effect of central acylated-ghrelin and DES-acetylated ghrelin (native ghrelin) on memory function and glucose metabolism in an experimentally induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model. AD rats were divided into 3 groups and Non-AD rats were used as a normal-control group. Each rat in the AD groups had intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of β-amyloid (25-35; 16.8nmol/day) into the lateral ventricle for 3 days, and then the pumps were changed to infuse either acylated-ghrelin (0.2nmol/h; AD-G), DES-acylated ghrelin (0.2nmol/h; AD-DES-G), or saline (control; AD-C) for 3 weeks. The Non-AD group had ICV infusion of β-amyloid (35-25) which does not deposit in the hippocampus. During the next 3 weeks memory function, food intake, body weight gain, body fat composition, and glucose metabolism were measured. AD-C exhibited greater β-amyloid deposition compared to Non-AD-C, and AD-G suppressed the increased β-amyloid deposition and potentiated the phosphorylation AMPK. In addition, AD-G increased the phosphorylation GSK and decreased the phosphorylation of Tau in comparison to AD-C and AD-DES-G. Cognitive function, measured by passive avoidance and water maze tests, was much lower in AD-C than Non-AD-C whereas AD-G but not AD-DES-G prevented the decrease (p<0.021). Body weight gain was lower in AD-C group than Non-AD-C group without changing epididymal fat mass. AD-G reversed the decrease in body weight which was due to increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure. The AD-G group exhibited a decrease in the second part of serum glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) compared to the AD-C and AD-DES-G group (p<0.009). However, area under the curve of insulin during the first part of OGTT was higher in AD-DES-G than other groups, whereas during the second part it was suppressed in AD-G as much as Non-AD. In conclusion, central acylated ghrelin in rats prevented the deterioration of memory function, and energy and glucose metabolisms were partially improved, possibly due to less β-amyloid accumulation. This research suggests that interventions such as intermittent fasting to facilitate sustained elevations of acyl-ghrelin should be investigated for cognitive and metabolic benefits, especially in person with early symptoms of memory impairment.""), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We examined whether MR antagonists can ameliorate GC-mediated skin barrier dysfunction in NHEKs, reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), and subjects under psychological stress (PS). In a preliminary clinical investigation, topical MR antagonists improved skin barrier function in topical GC-treated subjects.

Herein, we analyzed whether UVA aggravates the PM-induced inflammatory cascade, which contributes to the aging of skin-derived cells. We hypothesized that cellular senescence is involved in PM&UVA-induced aging and tested whether an l-ascorbic acid compound (LAC), containing vitamin E and ferulic acid, can inhibit PM&UVA-induced aging. PM&UVA-exposed HDFs showed further elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels detected by flow cytometry. We then demonstrated that PM induces MAPK signaling activation and the expression of AhR and NF-κB, responses that are both exacerbated by UVA. The levels of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6, were significantly higher in the PM&UVA-exposed group which resulted in increased transcription of MMPs, causing downregulation of type I collagen. Meanwhile, treatment with LAC reduced the levels of ROS and inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, PM&UVA-induced SA-β-gal production (staining assay) was reduced by LAC.

O-GlcNAcylation of tau can negatively regulate hyperphosphorylation and the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) from tau protein. Therefore, preventing tau hyperphosphorylation by increasing the levels of tau O-GlcNAcylation via OGA inhibitors could be a promising approach. Based on Thiamet-G, a potent OGA inhibitor, and its binding mode to OGA, a novel OGA inhibitor scaffold bearing three parts was designed and hit compound 7j was successfully identified via extensive exploring. Further chemical optimization and diversification of the 7j structure resulted in compound 39 which possesses excellent OGA inhibition, no cytotoxicity, and has good pharmacokinetic properties. In acute AD model mice, 39 was more effective than Thiamet-G in inhibiting OGA activity attributable to its better blood-brain barrier permeability. In addition, 39 restored the cognitive function in mice and reduced amyloid-β (Aβ) concentrations to a greater extent than Thiamet-G. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that 39 was well associated with OGA through H-bonds and hydrophobic interaction.

When ethyl acetate fraction from AY (EFAY) was administered to C57BL/6J mice fed with 60% HFD, EFAY significantly enhanced cognitive ability that was impaired by HFD in T-maze test and novel object recognition test. Furthermore, EFAY increased memory and learning functions that were proven during Morris water maze test. We further elucidated protective mechanisms of EFAY against cognitive decline that resulted from obesity by western blotting. In the brain, HFD increased neuronal inflammation and disturbed insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/Akt pathway. However, EFAY significantly downregulated inflammation-related protein expressions such as nuclear factor-κB interleukin-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, compared with the HFD-fed control group. Furthermore, the IRS-1/Akt pathway was regulated by EFAY, indicating that EFAY ameliorated insulin resistance in the brain. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Obesity and its complications increase the risk for developing cognitive dysfunction such as dementia. Administration of ethyl acetate fraction from AY (EFAY)-attenuated cognitive and memory impairment by inhibitions of neuronal oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive impairment mouse model. In addition, EFAY-administered mice disturbed cerebral insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/Akt pathway.

It was found that health-promoting behaviors were significantly correlated with electronic health literacy (r = 0.15, P < .05), perceived benefits (r = 0.15, P < .05), and self-efficacy (r = 0.47, P < .01). In the multiple linear regression analysis to identify the factors influencing health-promoting behaviors, electronic health literacy (β = .13, P = .040) and self-efficacy (β = .38, P < .001) were found to be significant factors, even after adjusting for general and disease-related characteristics. Strategies to improve health-promoting behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes should focus on analyzing levels of electronic health literacy and deepening their understanding of online information accordingly.')])"

For this purpose, the human adrenal H295R cell line and adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used. In the H295R cell line, all tested aniline derivatives decreased testosterone (T) levels. Regulatory changes of several steroidogenic genes, i.e., down-regulation of StAR or CYP17 genes, and up-regulation of CYP19A, observed in the H295R cells could explain the sex hormone disruption. In male zebrafish, generally similar directions of changes, i.e., decreases in T levels and increased E2/T ratios, were observed. Again, down-regulation of key steroidogenic genes such as cyp17 or 3β-hsd, but slight up-regulation of cyp19a gene observed in the fish could explain the sex hormone changes. The results of our study demonstrate that all tested aniline derivatives could influence steroidogenesis and disrupt sex hormone balance toward reduced androgenicity.

The secretion of mature GLP-1 is regulated via GPCRs, including bile acid receptor G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1, which uses cAMP signaling to enhance the exocytosis of GLP-1-containing vesicles. However, the role of cAMP-mediated transcription has not been clearly demonstrated to date. In this study, we explored the role of cAMP response element-binding protein/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CREB/CRTC2)-dependent transcription on GLP-1 secretion in the L cells. We found that the reduced CREB/CRTC2 activity impaired the cAMP-dependent increase in GLP-1 secretion, whereas expression of constitutively active CRTC2 increased GLP-1 exocytosis from the L cells. Close investigation revealed that expression of not only proglucagon but also PC1/3, an endopeptidase for GLP-1 maturation, is transcriptionally regulated by CREB/CRTC2. Furthermore, expression of peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor coactivator 1 α is also reduced upon depletion of CRTC2, leading to the decreased expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) genes, reduced ATP levels, and calcium concentrations in the L cells. Finally, we observed that intestine-specific CRTC2 knockout mice displayed reduced GLP-1 expression, leading to the lower plasma GLP-1 levels, impaired glucose tolerance, and decreased insulin-containing β cells in pancreatic islets. Our data show that the CREB/CRTC2-dependent transcriptional pathway is critical for regulating glucose homeostasis by controlling production of GLP-1 from the L cells at the level of transcription, maturation, and exocytosis.-Lee, J.-H., Wen, X., Cho, H., Koo, S.-H.

It also acts as a potent antioxidant and regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, although the exact action mechanism is not clear. The α2-HS-glycoprotein gene (AHSG) and its protein, fetuin-A (FETUA), are one of the hepatokines and are known to be associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin improves hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in a FETUA-dependent manner. In HepG2 cells treated with 300\xa0μmol/L of palmitic acid, phosphorylated AKT expression decreased, and FETUA expression increased, but this effect was inhibited by treatment with 10\xa0μmol/L of melatonin. However, melatonin did not improve insulin resistance in FETUA-overexpressing cells, indicating that improvement in insulin resistance by melatonin was dependent on downregulation of FETUA. Moreover, melatonin decreased palmitic acid-induced ER stress markers, CHOP, Bip, ATF-6, XBP-1, ATF-4, and PERK. In addition, in the high-fat diet (HFD) mice, oral treatment with 100\xa0mg/kg/day melatonin for 10\xa0weeks reduced body weight gain to one-third of that of the HFD group and hepatic steatosis. Insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance improved with the upregulation of muscle p-AKT protein expression.

To verify TCR specificity, we generated TCR-engineered T cells and confirmed recognition of the tumor-derived neoantigens.

Macrophage phagocytosis is a signature innate immune response to pathogen exposure, and cytoplasmic membrane expansion is required to engulf the phagocytic target. The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are key transcriptional regulatory proteins that sense the intracellular lipid environment and modulate expression of key genes of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism to maintain lipid homeostasis. In this study, we show that TLR4-dependent stimulation of macrophage phagocytosis requires mTORC1-directed SREBP-1a-dependent lipid synthesis. We also show that the phagocytic defect in macrophages from SREBP-1a-deficient mice results from decreased interaction between membrane lipid rafts and the actin cytoskeleton, presumably due to reduced accumulation of newly synthesized fatty acyl chains within major membrane phospholipids. We show that mTORC1-deficient macrophages also have a phagocytic block downstream from TLR4 signaling, and, interestingly, the reduced level of phagocytosis in both SREBP-1a- and mTORC1-deficient macrophages can be restored by ectopic SREBP-1a expression. Taken together, these observations indicate SREBP-1a is a major downstream effector of TLR4-mTORC1 directed interactions between membrane lipid rafts and the actin cytoskeleton that are required for pathogen-stimulated phagocytosis in macrophages.'), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating the expression levels of genes associated with AD development. In this study, we analyzed miRNAs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients and cognitively normal (including amyloid positive) individuals. miR-1273g-3p was identified as an AD-associated miRNA and found to be elevated in the CSF of early-stage AD patients. The overexpression of miR-1273g-3p enhanced amyloid beta (Aβ) production by inducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairments in AD model cell lines. A biotin-streptavidin pull-down assay demonstrated that miR-1273g-3p primarily interacts with mitochondrial genes, and that their expression is downregulated by miR-1273g-3p. In particular, the miR-1273g-3p-target gene TIMM13 showed reduced expression in brain tissues from human AD patients. These results suggest that miR-1273g-3p expression in an early stage of AD notably contributes to Aβ production and mitochondrial impairments.

Further untargeted metabolomics analysis using gas chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry reveals that silencing of CENPF alters the global metabolic profiles of PC cells and inhibits cell proliferation, which suggests that CENPF may be a critical regulator of PC metabolism. These findings provide useful scientific insights that can be applied in future studies investigating potential targets for PC treatment.""), ('CopyrightInformation', '© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

NP formulation was performed by reacting EGF peptide with N-hydroxysuccinimide-Polyethylene Glycol-1,2-Distearoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine (NHS-PEG-DSPE), followed by efficient curcumin loading through lipid film hydration. EGF conjugation did not significantly affect NP size, zeta potential or morphology. Specific targeting was confirmed by EGF receptor activation and blocking of I-labeled NP binding by excess EGF. EGF-Cur-NP dose-dependently suppressed MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell survival (IC50, 620 nM), and completely abolished their capacity to form colonies. The cytotoxic effects were more potent compared with those of free curcumin or Cur-NP.

International collaborations and large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies have made these achievements possible. However, whether the identified common variants are causal is largely unknown. In addition, the detailed mechanism of how these genetic variants exert their effect on the pathogenesis of T2DM requires further investigation. Currently, there are ongoing large-scale sequencing studies to identify rare, functional variants for T2DM. Environmental factors also have a crucial role in the development of T2DM. These could modulate gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNA regulation. There is evidence that epigenetic changes are important in the development of T2DM. Recent studies have identified several DNA methylation markers of T2DM from peripheral blood and pancreatic islets. In this review, we will briefly summarize the recent progress in the genetic and epigenetic research on T2DM and discuss how environmental factors, genetics and epigenetics can interact in the pathogenesis of T2DM.')])"

During liver injury, HSCs trans-differentiate into activated myofibroblasts which produce alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and become a major cell type in hepatic fibrogenesis. Succinate and succinate receptor (GPR91) signaling has emerged as a regulator to promote α-SMA production in MCD diet- induced mice.

The concentrations of marker polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were significantly associated with increased change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) and triglyceride levels during a 1-year follow-up, after controlling for sex, age, household income, and change in body mass index. Total PCBs also showed a marginal association with increasing cMetS score from the baseline. Of the metabolic components, change in diastolic BP over time showed a notable association with specific PCBs, but no association with organochlorine pesticides. Here, we found that low-dose exposures to PCBs among children in the general population could negatively influence metabolic health, particularly diastolic BP. Increased disease sensitivity during childhood can continue to adulthood, thus, these results support the need for continuous assessment of the health impact of POPs.')])"

HuD expression was frequently lost in many human pancreatic NETs, and these pancreatic NETs showed aggressive clinicopathological phenotypes with low p27 levels, increased tumor size, higher World Health Organization grade and pT stage of the tumor, and the presence of angioinvasion. Furthermore, loss of HuD was an independent, progression-free prognostic factor in multivariate survival analysis. However, the level of HuR, a member of the same Hu protein family as HuD, was not significantly correlated with pancreatic NET size and progression.

Both disorders are caused by the same gene, but ML II represents the more severe phenotype. Bone manifestations of ML II include hip dysplasia, scoliosis, rickets and osteogenesis imperfecta. In this study, we sought to determine whether a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (AAV2/8-GNPTAB) could confer high and prolonged gene expression of GNPTAB and thereby influence the pathology in the cartilage and bone tissue of a GNPTAB knock out (KO) mouse model. The results demonstrated significant increases in bone mineral density and content in AAV2/8-GNPTAB-treated as compared to non-treated KO mice. We also showed that IL-6 (interleukin-6) expression in articular cartilage was reduced in AAV2/8-GNPTAB treated ML II mice.

Here we show that B7-H3 is highly expressed in mature osteoclasts and that B7-H3 deficiency leads to the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis in human osteoclast precursors (OCPs). High-throughput transcriptomic analyses reveal that B7-H3 inhibition upregulates IFN signaling as well as IFN-inducible genes, including IDO. Pharmacological inhibition of type-I IFN and IDO knockdown leads to reversal of B7-H3-deficiency-mediated osteoclastogenesis suppression.

PERK activation by CO increased intracellular Ca concentration and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin against TFEB. Moreover, we found that in the deficiency of TFEB, CO not only failed to recruit Parkin to the mitochondria but also failed to increase expression of lysosomal genes such as Lamp1, CathB, and TPP1. Therefore, we suggest that CO increases mitophagy through TFEB nuclear translocation by PERK-calcinuerin activation. In addition, the inhibition of TFEB with siRNA against TFEB abrogated the increase of mtDNA with CO, markers of mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC1α, NRF1, and TFAM, and the mitochondrial proteins COX II, COX IV, and cytochrome c.

Furthermore, the relationship between the effect of exenatide on the changes in the relative abundance of microRNAs (miRNAs), which play a role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, is not fully understood. Therefore, we assessed the effect of exenatide on miRNA expression in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model of obesity. Both HFD control and exenatide-treated HFD mice showed similar body weight gain and increase in β-cell mass. Insulin levels were significantly lower in exenatide-treated mice than in HFD control mice. The levels of miRNA-15a, 29c, 124a, and 375 in the pancreas were significantly increased in HFD control mice. Furthermore, the levels of miRNA-29c, 124a, and 146a in the liver and miRNA-15a, 29c, 124a, and 146a in the muscle were significantly increased. In contrast, the levels of miRNA-15a, 29c, 124a, and 375 in the serum were significantly decreased. These effects were reversed by treatment with exenatide. Our results provide experimental evidence that exenatide-mediated amelioration of insulin sensitivity is associated with antagonistic changes in the relative abundance of miRNA-15a, 29c, 124a, and 375 in tissues and serum, thus highlighting their usefulness as biomarkers for monitoring insulin sensitivity and response to exenatide treatment in experimental diabetes.'), ('CopyrightInformation', 'Copyright © 2015 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Several previous studies compared the costs of interventions or evaluated recurrence, complications, or quality of life as measures of their effectiveness. Regarding costs, most studies focused on direct costs and applied hypothetical models. Cost-minimization analysis should be distinguished from simple cost analysis. Furthermore, due to the universality of the term ""cost-effectiveness analysis"" (CEA), several studies have not distinguished CEA from cost-utility analysis; this point needs to be considered in future research. Cost-benefit analyses have not been conducted in previous TC research. Since TC has a high survival rate and good prognosis, the need for economic evaluations has recently been pointed out.

The subtyping of NE tumors is based on the number of mitoses per high powered field and the presences of necrosis. However, the best diagnostic criteria to differentiate various subtypes of lung NE tumors remains controversial and few diagnostic markers distinguish typical and atypical carcinoid. In this study, we show that FAIM2, an inhibitory molecule in the Fas-apoptosis pathway, is significantly overexpressed in SCLC compared to non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, FAIM2 expression is significantly higher in atypical carcinoid than typical carcinoid. As atypical carcinoid has been shown to have worse clinical outcomes than typical carcinoid, our data suggests that FAIM2 may be a useful diagnostic marker for atypical carcinoid. Knockdown of FAIM2 expression increases Fas-induced apoptotic cell death in SCLC cells. Etoposide treatment combined with FAIM2 inhibition also shows modest but significant reduction of viable SCLC cells. Taken together, our results suggest that FAIM2 is a potential NE tumor marker with higher expression in atypical carcinoid and SCLC, and could be a new therapeutic target for SCLC.')])"

Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes contributes to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), thereby resulting in hepatic fibrogenesis. High-temperature requirement protein A2 (HtrA2/Omi), a mitochondrial serine protease with various functions, is responsible for quality control in mitochondrial homeostasis. However, little information is available regarding its role in mitochondrial damage during the development of liver fibrosis. This study examined whether HtrA2/Omi regulates mitochondrial homeostasis in hepatocyte during the development of hepatic fibrogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that HtrA2/Omi expression considerably decreased in liver tissues from the CCl-induced liver fibrotic mice model and from patients with liver cirrhosis. Knockdown of HtrA2/Omi in hepatocytes induced the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and provoked mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) stress. We further show that the damaged mtDNA isolated from HtrA2/Omi-deficient hepatocytes as a form of damage-associated molecular patterns can induce HSCs activation. Moreover, we found that motor neuron degeneration 2-mutant mice harboring the missense mutation Ser276Cys in the protease domain of HtrA2/Omi displayed altered mitochondrial morphology and function, which increased oxidative stress and promoted liver fibrosis. Conversely, the overexpression of HtrA2/Omi via hydrodynamics-based gene transfer led to the antifibrotic effects in CCl-induced liver fibrosis mice model through decreasing collagen accumulation and enhancing anti-oxidative activity by modulating mitochondrial homeostasis in the liver. These results suggest that suppressing HtrA2/Omi expression promotes hepatic fibrogenesis via modulating mtROS generation, and these novel mechanistic insights involving the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis by HtrA2/Omi may be of importance for developing new therapeutic strategies for hepatic fibrosis.')]))])"
